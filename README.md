# Personal-Project-Image-Reviewer

Hello World, I am a person who loves to make tools that minimizes the workload and boosts the work efficiency by atleast 5x  
This tool is an Image Reviewer App, which helps to review bulk images easily.

To be specific, here the work is to choose a good image from a folder of 5 images. Like this there will be 1000s of folder. 
There will be 4 images generated by an AI Site. Only one image from those needs to be selected. So its difficult to open each folder and view one by one of them and select the good image.

So I came up with this little tool to make my work easy, absolutely this tool is not going to help everyone. Its just a personal project.

## How to use the Tool

This tool will show the images folder by folder and image by image inside each folder.
Left & Right Arrows will help move to next & previous folders smoothly.
Up and Down Arrows will help to switch between the image in the current folder.
You can keep the current image which is good enough without any big error in the frame, this is considered as Selected image.
Next you move on to the next folder, once you are done with all folder, in the last folder on the top right corner you will see an Save Batch option to save all images that were kept in the screen.

This helped me review 1000 folders in around 1 hour max, actually that good ig. 

Note: This is an Mac App.
